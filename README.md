Use the [ClickbotPro app](https://clickbot.pro) with this bot to have a user-friendly interface. Once you start it, the bot will reply to your contacts on your behalf using ChatGPT. In the Input-Settings, you can choose which contacts you want it to affect. It will always respond to your own messages.

To get started, you need to link this bot to your WhatsApp by scanning a QR code and providing the initial prompt.
For example:
```bash
- Pretend to be my friend Kyle, using typos and short phrases.
- Pretend to be a ninja who's trying to live a peaceful life. Use short answers. Stay in character forever.
- Communicate only using only descriptive gestures. Don't write text.
```

Limitations:
```bash
- If you don't provide your own ChatGPT API key, there is a limit of 100 messages per day.
- It will only respond to new/unread messages. Archived messages will be ignored.
```

## Installation
