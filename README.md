## About PDF-Merger

<img src="icon.png" />

Use this module with the [ClickbotPro app](https://clickbot.pro) to put multiple PDF files together. It has an easy-to-use setup where you can pick input and output files, plus other handy settings. 
You can even add images in between the PDFs. 
The files will merge in the order of their names. So, just name them in the order you want. You might use a numbered list like this:

```bash
1-invoice123.pdf
2-documentX.pdf
3-screenshot.png
4-documentation.pdf
```

## Installation

The installation can take place through ClickbotPro or via the npm CLI.

```bash
npm i pdf-merger-bot
